Hello! ðŸ˜Ž

This is a simple console application built using VB.NET and MailKit .NET library that connects to your Gmail account via IMAP, scans last 50 emails for common spam keywords, and moves suspected spam emails to the junk folder. 

This app is based on a real-world spam filtering tool I developed for a client. They were using Google Workspace within a VB.NET legacy system.

Features:

- Secure IMAP connection to Gmail
- Scans subject lines for spam-related keywords
- Moves matching emails to the junk/spam folder
- Processes the 50 most recent emails
- Lightweight, easily extendable console application
